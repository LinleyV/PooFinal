The first thing to do is do ensure the "comunication between the two classes". As the class "Balle" will be, in fact, a mobile object, it will enherit all the atributs
and methods of the parent class. Therefore, the attributs and the methods have no meaning here. Now, when we removed the attributs, we are left with a
problem regarding our constructor. Thus, we will need to fix it, using the constructor of the super-class. Lastlty, there are methods (ex. "find_density", "get_radius")
that we won't use, because these methods will be integrated in the parent class and for the moment there is no reason to shadow them.
